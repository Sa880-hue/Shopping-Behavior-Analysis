⦁	**Review Rating-** Customer rating for the product
⦁	**Frequency of Purchases-** How often customers shop


### Tools & Technologies Used

⦁	**RStudio** (Development environment)
⦁	**ggplot2** (Data visualization)
⦁	**dplyr** (Data manipulation)
⦁	**Excel** (Initial inspection and cleaning)
⦁	**GitHub** (Version control and project hosting)


### Key Analyses & Visualizations

1.	Customer Spending Distribution
⦁	Analyzed how much customers generally spend per transaction using a histogram.
⦁	Most purchases fall within a mid-range spending bracket.

⦁	Identified the Top 10 most purchased items using frequency counts.
⦁	Visualized using a horizontal bar chart for easy comparison.

3. Impact of Discounts on Purchase Amount
⦁	Compared spending behavior for customer with vs without discounts.
⦁	Used boxplots to analyze median spending and variability.

4. Subscription Status vs Spending
⦁	Analyzed whether subscribers spend more than non-subscribers.

8. Purchase Frequency Analysis
⦁	Analyzed how often customers make purchases using a bar chart.

### Business Insights

⦁	Customers generally exhibit moderate spending behavior, with most purchases centered around $60 range.

⦁	Top-selling items such as clothing and accessories drive the majority of purchases, highlighting strong demand in these categories.

⦁	Discounts do not significantly increase purchase amount, suggesting discounts influence buying decisions rather than transaction value.

⦁	Subscribers and non-subscribers show similar spending patterns, indicating scope to improve subscription benefits.

⦁	Loyal customers display more consistency spending behavior, reinforcing the value of retention strategies.

⦁	Clothing and Footwear categories generate relatively higher median purchase values, making them key revenue drivers.

⦁	Review ratings show only a week relationship with purchase amount, implying higher satisfaction does not always lead to higher spending.

⦁	Customers tend to purchase infrequently, commonly once every three months or annually, indicating growth potential through repeat-purchase strategies.


### Conclusion & Recommendations

Instead, product categories and customer retention play a more meaningful role in shaping overall revenue.

#### Business Recommendations

⦁	Focus on increasing purchase frequency, as customers currently buy relatively infrequently.

⦁	Prioritize inventory and marketing for high-demand categories like Clothing and Footwear.

⦁	Re-evaluate subscription programs to provide clearer value and differentiation.

⦁	Use discounts strategically for customer acquisition, not as a primary revenue driver.

⦁	Leverage customer reviews for service improvement and trust-building, rather than expecting higher order values.
